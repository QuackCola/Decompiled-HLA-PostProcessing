Decompiled Half Life: Alyx vpost files

Got what useable info I could from [VRF](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/ValveResourceFormat) to reconstruct the HLA vpost files. In the case that a vpost file is missing something go ahead and let me know in [Issues](https://github.com/QuackCocaine/Decompiled-HLA-PostProcessing/issues).
